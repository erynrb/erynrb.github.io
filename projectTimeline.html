                    <b>Context:</b> This project was undertaken within the context of Praxis 2 - ESC102. The aim was to design an improved 
                    system for transporting mushrooms between Guelph and Toronto for Noki Farms. The key requirements were grouped under four main categories: optimal mushroom health, spatial optimization, durability, and efficiency. These requirements allowed us to frame our design space, leading to a design that protects the health of the mushrooms, wastes little space, can withstand foreseeable forces, and does not sacrifice ease of use and speed. <br><br>
                    <b>Contributions:</b> I wrote sections of our design reports, managed timelines and tasks, and built a prototype to test and demonstrate our design concept.<br><br>
                    <b>Skills and Tools:</b> Power tools (drills, bandsaw), written communication, verbal communication, FDCR framework, prototyping.<br><br>
                    <b>Outcomes:</b> We created a design of a portable fridge with modular shelves made out of netting. The fridge has the option to be charged by solar power or a regular AC power supply. Additionally, the shelf frames are made of polyactic acid (PLA), a plastic made from renewable sources, and the nets are made from bamboo fibre yarn. Our team was shortlisted for the Ian and Shirley Rowe Award.</p>
