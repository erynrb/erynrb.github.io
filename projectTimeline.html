                <div class="column4"><p>SaskWatch is an IoT solution to collect and share wildfire-relevant data in remote areas of the Boreal Plains of Saskatchewan. It consists of a ‘Ground Station’ and ‘Balloon Module’ which together compose a ‘Tethered Weather Station’ (TWS) that connects via a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network to a Central Uplink Peer, which connects to a Server, and data is then displayed on the SaskWatch App. The App displays fire risk data, along with a ‘repair and retrieval’ tab and a ‘educate and learn’ tab. In Praxis III, my team (Evelyn Fallah, Sasha Mee, Liam Cadieux, Daniel Pinto, Cai Seigel) and myself prototyped this solution.<br><br>I leveraged skills I had been developing over the course of the semester from PSA as well as from my extracurricular involvement with the University of Toronto Aerospace Team (UTAT). Through these, I had a baseline confidence in working with CAD, and was able to use this during the build process. I took initiative in building the mechanical components of the anemometer, and learned CAM through this process. One of my team members had more experience with this, and was able to support my learning by helping me submit my first few print orders. I needed to submit many (n=5) print orders for the anemometer specifically. At the end of Phase 3, I now feel confident that I am able to 3D print without support, which was one of my major goals for ESC204.

            <p>In November 2024, I was able to launch an L1 rocket at the Upstate Research Rocketry Group. My rocket (Minerva)'s flight was successful, and I am now L1 High Power Rocket Certified! I decided to pursue this certification on October 2nd, and I launched a month later on November 2nd. Despite the compressed timeline (building and painting a kit in under 3 weeks while balancing the Engineering Science 2F timetable is no joke), I had so much fun completing this project - in large part due to the amazing support from people who had done this before on University of Toronto Aerospace Team. This build has taught me so much about hard work, dedication, and the value of working on a project from beginning to end. My rocket had a nominal flight with successful deployment of a parachute using an ejection charge. There was no zippering experienced, and I was able to recover the rocket in excellent shape. I'm so grateful for the people and team who made this possible, and I'm looking forward to taking on more exciting projects!

            <p> Reflection written in August 2024:
            <br><br>This past summer (2024), I had the opportunity and privilege of working at the Sensing in Biomechanical Processes Lab (SimPL) in UBC's Mechanical Engineering Department. I worked on a project that is investigating the impact of shift work on sleep in a nurse population. My contributions focussed on the processing of accelerometry data to identify periods of sleep over a 10 night/11 day period. I completed a literature review and applied this learning to write MATLAB code that processes actigraphy data according to a variety of algorithms (Cole-Kripke, Sadeh, Sazonov, etc.) and visualizes the result. I worked with others in the lab to interpret these results and share findings with our participants.
            <br><br>I gained deeper insight into what I did because of the supportive, friendly, and positive lab environment fostered by Dr. Wu. We had weekly whole-lab meetings where everyone shared what they had been working on, and one person would host a workshop or practice an upcoming presentation. These weekly presentations were incredibly interesting, and I learned about balance, concussions, brain strain, processing EEG data, and more. The feedback and questions shared by other members of the lab helped me gain a stronger understanding of what makes a good presentation and taught me about how to give and receive feedback. Often, members of the lab would ask questions about figures I was sharing that prompted me to think more deeply about the data I was working with, leaving me with a greater understanding of the project.
            <br><br>I learned so much this summer both academically and personally. In addition to MATLAB skills (which were reinforced from ESC103 through real world applications), I gained insights into the research process. I also had the opportunity to draft part of a paper, present the idea for the paper, and present a different study I had been working on with other undergraduate students. I learned about my preferred work style and developed further self-direction skills because I had the opportunity to follow my own interests, set timelines, and work towards goals I set. Because of this, I feel more prepared for self-directed work in future. I learned how to communicate my ideas in a lab setting and gained confidence in myself and my knowledge. These skills are applicable to my studies in EngSci, and I look forward to approaching this year with improved communication and problem solving skills. 
            <br><br>Working in SimPL with people who are interested in the clinical applications of engineering and how engineering can improve the lived experience of individuals has piqued my interest in biomedical engineering. This summer has given me a deeper appreciation of how much effort goes into graduate projects, the amount of passion that is necessary to drive the work that is being done, and how valuable real-life experience in the field you are studying can be. These lessons have made me consider seeking industry experience before beginning graduate studies. This summer has made me more confident that I will be able to complete graduate studies if I choose that path. The support and encouragement of my supervisors and other graduate students has made me feel like there is a place for me here, and in academia as a whole.
            <br><br>Living and working in Vancouver was different from my experiences in Toronto and has made me even more interested in travelling in the future. The greenery and hiking culture was a complete change from going to school downtown. Being able to leave work and see both the ocean and mountains if I took a five minute detour on my way home was amazing, and the experience of spending so much time surrounded by nature kept me grounded.
            <br><br>I know this experience will serve me for the rest of my life. This summer has, at the risk of sounding like a coming of age movie, changed my life. I have learned about myself and  graduate studies, gained confidence, developed work skills, and made friends I will treasure forever. I look forward to my next visit to Vancouver, and whatever adventures come next.</p>

            <h3 class="projectTitle">Praxis 2: Netted Fridge</h3>
            <div class="projectImage"><img src="images/Netted Fridge Graphics.png"><p>Graphics by Lucy Matchette and Jiayu Li</p></div>
            <p>Project Context: This project was undertaken within the context of Praxis 2 - ESC102. The project was to create an improved 
                system for transporting mushrooms over one hour between Guelph and Toronto. The primary stakeholder in this project was 
                one of the co owners of the farm who transports the mushrooms. After receiving the request for proposal created by the 
                authoring team (Caitlin Croskery, Usman Wani, Rafiah Islam, and Yash Nishit Kapadia) and meeting with one of the primary 
                stakeholders, my team and I (Jiayu Li, Sarah Anthony, Lucy Matchette, and myself) reframed requirements and scope to more 
                accurately reflect what we felt was the most important part of the RFP.
                <br><br>
                Key Design Considerations: The key requirements were able to be grouped under four main categories: optimal mushroom health,
                 spatial optimization, durability, and efficiency. These requirements allowed us to frame our design space, leading to a 
                 design that protects the health of the mushrooms, wastes little space, can withstand foreseeable forces, and does not 
                 sacrifice ease of use and speed. An additional design consideration that we considered less formally was sustainability. 
                 By consulting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UNSDGs) [1], we noted areas where we could improve our 
                 designs sustainability, such as in material selection or energy supply.
                 <br><br>
                Key Design Features: The design is a portable fridge (approximately 50x29x24cm) with modular shelves (the centres of 
                which are made of nets to allow for cushioning of the mushrooms). The fridge has the option to be charged by solar power 
                or a regular AC power supply, contributing to its sustainable aspects (specifically this ties into UNSDG 7: Clean and 
                Affordable Energy). Additionally, the shelf frames are made of polyactic acid (PLA), a plastic made from renewable sources, 
                and the nets are made from bamboo fibre yarn (a soft and washable material derived from bamboo, a highly renewable source).
                <br><br>
                Implications of My Position on the Design Process: My team and I all highly value sustainability, and this project allowed 
                us to explore the applications of sustainability to a real-life scenario. We made a significant number of design decisions 
                based on this value (as mentioned above), which impacted the way we performed engineering design.
                Skills and Experiences Gained: Through this project, I gained experience with prototyping. As part of our process, we made 
                multiple prototypes to represent our ideas. I personally drew multiple basic sketches to communicate with my team and gain 
                feedback before proceeding. Also, I built two different prototypes out of wood - one as a potential design that didn't move 
                forward, and one as one of our final prototypes. Through this, I gained experience in making decisions about what aspects 
                of designs are truly “unbelievable” and need to be prototyped, what aspects are more easily communicated through which 
                means (for example: the actual use of the prototype was easier to show through a physical prototype, whereas the electric 
                components and more precise aspects were easier to show through a CAD model (made by Lucy Matchette).)

                    <img src="images/CIV102 MATLAB Output.png"><p>MATLAB code output</p>
            </div>
            <p>Project Context: This project was undertaken as part of the course work for CIV102 - 
                Structures and Materials. The purpose was to design a bridge made exclusively of 
                matboard and contact cement to withstand a dynamic load applied during bridge testing. 
                This project was completed with Zarah Mathew and Ahana Jhamb.
                <br><br>
                Key Design Considerations: When designing our bridge, 
                our goal was to make the bridge as strong as possible. We considered cross 
                sectional shape and matboard splice connection. This was informed by calculations 
                done by hand (figure 1), then recreated and coded in MATLAB so that we were able to 
                test for a variety of designs quickly (results shown in figure 2). These calculations showed the 
                expected failure point for each position of the moving load, and the applied mode of 
                failure (either force or moment).
                <br><br>
                Key Design Features: The design features a tall, hollow structural section. The height was 
                chosen to minimize the stress (by increasing height, the stress is decreased) and the hollow 
                section was chosen to reduce material usage and weight.
                <br><br>
                Implications of My Position on the Design Process: During this design process, my team and 
                I decided to try to play to our strengths. Because, as part of my position, I felt I would 
                be good at doing some of the coding and initial calculations, I started with that. I coded a lot of the
                MATLAB code while other members of the team started coming up with designs for us to test against the code 
                when it was finished. After we had finalised our design, I used my previous experience with building to take a 
                leadership role in the construction aspect. My team members, who felt more confident with writing and 
                explaining the design process, took a leadership role on that.
                <br><br>
                Skills and Experiences Gained: From this experience, I gained more skill with coding practical 
                applications of MATLAB. I coded a significant amount of the main function of our MATLAB code, 
                which was used to run simulations of how well different bridge designs would perform under the dynamic 
                loading cases. I also learned more about how long it really takes for good iteration and design to be 
                done - a lot longer than we had budgeted for. This means that moving forward, I will aim to allow for 
                more time to iterate.

            <h3 class="projectTitle">Praxis 1: The Waxed Canopy</h3>
            <div class="projectImage"><img src="images/waxed canopy.png"><p>Created with Zarah Mathew, Ben Huff, and Aakash Nandy</p></div>
            <p>Project Context: This project was completed during ESC101 - Praxis 1. 
                My team (Aakash Nandy, Zarah Mathew, Benjamin Huff) and I chose a design 
                brief relating to the nuisance of a wet umbrella. The goal of the project 
                was to design something (either a new umbrella or a type of technology) to 
                reduce the annoyance surrounding having to carry a wet umbrella with you all day. 
                The scope of the project was restricted to University of Toronto engineering students. 
                This is because students don't have an office on campus to leave an umbrella, 
                and engineering students (on average) have busier schedules than students in other 
                faculties meaning they are outside more often.</p>
            <p> Key Design Considerations: In creating our design, we considered the usability of the 
                umbrella or piece of technology, consumer appeal, water resistance of materials, time 
                it takes the umbrella to dry, water transfer to other materials, and amount of puddle 
                the design creates.</p>
            <p>Key Design Features: Our recommended design at the end of Praxis 1 was essentially a regular 
                umbrella, except we had changed the material significantly. Umbrellas are typically made 
                of a nylon type material that, while somewhat water resistant, will also absorb water. 
                Based on proxy tests and research done, my team and I concluded that a waxed canvas material 
                will absorb significantly less water than the currently used most popular solution.</p>
            <p>Skills and Experiences Gained: Through this experience I gained many teamwork skills. 
                Up until this point, I hadn’t done any significant group work with people I didn’t know well. 
                By approaching this project with an open mind, I was able to work well with the team 
                assigned by the teaching team. I also found that through this experience, I was able to learn 
                more about how to take on leadership roles. My leadership skills improved drastically, and I was 
                able to gain experience with learning the strengths and weaknesses of team members and delegating 
                tasks accordingly.</p>
