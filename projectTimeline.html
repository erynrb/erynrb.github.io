            <p>Project Context: This project was completed during ESC101 - Praxis 1. 
                My team (Aakash Nandy, Zarah Mathew, Benjamin Huff) and I chose a design 
                brief relating to the nuisance of a wet umbrella. The goal of the project 
                was to design something (either a new umbrella or a type of technology) to 
                reduce the annoyance surrounding having to carry a wet umbrella with you all day. 
                The scope of the project was restricted to University of Toronto engineering students. 
                This is because students don't have an office on campus to leave an umbrella, 
                and engineering students (on average) have busier schedules than students in other 
                faculties meaning they are outside more often.</p>
            <p> Key Design Considerations: In creating our design, we considered the usability of the 
                umbrella or piece of technology, consumer appeal, water resistance of materials, time 
                it takes the umbrella to dry, water transfer to other materials, and amount of puddle 
                the design creates.</p>
            <p>Key Design Features: Our recommended design at the end of Praxis 1 was essentially a regular 
                umbrella, except we had changed the material significantly. Umbrellas are typically made 
                of a nylon type material that, while somewhat water resistant, will also absorb water. 
                Based on proxy tests and research done, my team and I concluded that a waxed canvas material 
                will absorb significantly less water than the currently used most popular solution.</p>
            <p>Skills and Experiences Gained: Through this experience I gained many teamwork skills. 
                Up until this point, I hadn’t done any significant group work with people I didn’t know well. 
                By approaching this project with an open mind, I was able to work well with the team 
                assigned by the teaching team. I also found that through this experience, I was able to learn 
                more about how to take on leadership roles. My leadership skills improved drastically, and I was 
                able to gain experience with learning the strengths and weaknesses of team members and delegating 
                tasks accordingly.</p>
